Welcome to my blog! I've had several blogs over the years, but this is the first one dedicated to my web development. I've been studying front end development 
for the past couple years now, but I am finally dedicating myself to learning it. I am primarily learning through online resources (some paid, some free)
and good old trial and error. Tomorrow I'll write about why I decided not go attend a coding bootcamp.
