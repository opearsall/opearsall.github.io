Welcome to my blog! I've had several blogs over the years, but this is the first one solely dedicated to my web development.* I've been studying front end development 
for the past couple years now, but I am finally dedicating myself to learning it thoroughly. I am primarily learning through online resources (some paid, some free)
and good old trial and error. 

*Okay, that is not toally true. I alsp have a blog called [The Crafty Coder](http://thecraftycoder.wordpress.com) that is related to web development. I updated it once almost a year ago, and then never again. It might get deleted. I like this one better.
