Hello, end of 2016. It's been a crazy year, right? Lots of change and whatnot. Both on a personal and more worldly level. In terms of positive change for me this year two big things happened â€” I got married (remind me to post pictures of that in a future blog post) and I left the job I have held over the past two years.

I have the whole week off between jobs which I am very excited about. I plan to:

Sew a knitting project bag  
Take a trip to Vancouver, B.C. for the first time in over a year  
Visit Glenn's parents  
Cut my hair (I cut it on my birthday but I didn't allow myself enough time)  
Finish a knitting project, start another one  
And we'll see what else I can get up to.

The end of the year has me thinking about goals and what I'd like to accomplish next year. I made a post on Facebook earlier this month about what I would like to do. My goals are to:

    1. Become a more proficient knitter.
    2. Become a better writer.
    3. Get back in touch with my creative side. Take more pictures and draw more.
    4. Learn to tap dance.
    5. Figure out my career.
    6. Make a website. (Hey, you're on it.)
    7. Read 33 books.

I plan to blog about accomplishing these goals (or failing at succeeding at them) on a regular basis. In addition to focusing on these goals I am thinking about how I can make myself more vulnerable. It's a little hard to explain what I mean by that, but I'd generally like to put myself out there a little more than I have in the past. In general, I am a fairly secretive, guarded person and I have trouble sharing things. I'd like to get better at that. This means doing things like writing code that's not perfect, writing honest blog posts like this one, posting more in general, and saying yes more than saying no.
