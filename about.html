<p>I've been tinkering with websites ever since the Geocities days. However, I never really got terribly good at making them, and they weren't all that pretty. Sure was fun, though! Now sites are so much better (and there's so much more to learn).</p>
<p>I am learning front end development on my own, through Treehouse and Free Code Camp. I'm also interested in computer science and interaction design.</p>
<p>When I am not practicing web development, I am either working on or obsessively researching my other hobbies: analog photography, knitting, sewing, sketching, and collecting fountain pens.</p>
