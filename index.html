<p class="bio">Hello! My name is Oleya. I &#x2764; front end development, textiles and writing.</p>
<p class="bio">I really like to make things. I spend my nights and weekends self-studying front end development. I can't decide if web development is more fun than knitting or vice-versa. I'm glad I discovered both. I live in Portland, OR with my husband, cat, and entirely way too much yarn.</p>
